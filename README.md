# Hi, I'm Marek! ðŸ‘‹

I've been designing, building, and maintaining architecture and development operations since 2019 and it's my passion. My career roots from spatial data and my university education in geospatial information systems. It has naturally evolved with the rapid growth of technology to include machine learning, web development, backend process engineering, cloud infrastructure engineering, and developer operations.
